# learn_express
My journey learning the Express web framework for Node.Js

What is this repository?

This repository is simply a bunch of mini-projects and example code as I teach myself Express. I am Essentially just reading through 
the Express website ( https://expressjs.com/ ) and writing code to help me learn and retain information along the way.

Goal:

I hope to learn as much Node.JS as I can while learning Express at the same time. Ideally this experiance will give me a base set of tools 
with which I can begin to create API's for web applications and/or mobile apps.

Other info:
- I am not fluent in javascript iether, I am hoping to pick it up along the way
- Putting this on Github is just an excuse to get familiar with using github
